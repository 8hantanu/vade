## What is VADE? 🤔

VADE (Van AD Express) is a dynamic platform that connects advertisers with commercial vehicle owners, creating a seamless opportunity for brands to reach more people. Drivers sign up their vehicles to feature ad space, while advertisers select their campaign specifications — from the number of vehicles to areas they want to target. As these vehicles traverse the city, your brand gains daily exposure, traveling to high-traffic zones and parking in strategic locations.
